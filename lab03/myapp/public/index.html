	<p>Here are the answers to the lab questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3.1</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A1) The purpose of node.js is to build event driven i/o using JavaScript.</li>
                <li>A2) Express.js is build ontop of node.js to build web applications.</li>
                <li>B) package.json contains information about the application, such as author, version, and express information.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>3.2</li>
            <ul>
                <li>a) They are static in that we are not creating them dynamically with server-side code. They remain the same until changed by the client and updated.</li>
                <li>b) I would venture a guess to say no, because it is not firing that message in the network. It is also working in the static file within the public directory, so it would not keep sending a message in the application.</li>
            </ul>
