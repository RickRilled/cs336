6.1
A) GET, HEAD, POST seems to be the methods I am able to test using those two tools. I get back the text in res.send() within those methods. Curl cannot resolve the PUT proxy since put requires a resourse to send between the server/client. DELETE needs something to delete or it will not function.

B)GET will be the best since you can post onto page and still display information

6.2
A)HTML forms only support GET and POST.

B)Through the request and response methods between the client/server, in JSON format to be parsed. The data is modified to include a key with the value.
