For my project, I would like to do an album ranking chart. Essentialy, you would input the name of the album and the artist. You would then assign a weight to the album "n", where "n" is no greater than the total number of albums on the list. If there is only one album, you can only give it a ranking of 1. As you add albums, the UI updates accordingly and shows you a list, in descending order, of the albums you've added. Adding an album would move any albums below it down one space. You should also be able to edit each albums weight, in case you change your mind.
